## Task 1. Editing a csv file in a QT widget project

NOTICE. THIS TASK SHOULD ONLY BE ATTEMPTED UPON COMPLETING QT_display_csv task (DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE).

Examine the project QT_edit_csv.pro. 
This project outputs a csv file on the form using a tableWidget as shown in the picture.

![form_with_data](https://github.com/marymex/QT_display_csv/blob/main/form_with_data.jpg)

This project also is able to edit the table when the user double-clicks a cell in it (see the picture). 

![dialog_form](https://github.com/marymex/QT_edit_csv/blob/main/dialog_form.jpg)

The user is able to save the changed file in a different .csv file by chosing the "Save" option in the menu. 

![dialog_form2](https://github.com/marymex/QT_edit_csv/blob/main/dialog_form2.jpg)

Run the project and check this functionality.

Your task is to take the project from a DIFFERENT repository, namelly QT_display_csv (which can only display the .csv file but NOT edit)
and implement some more code so that your project can edit the .csv file too.
This QT_edit_csv project is intended to be used for reference only.
